<h1>Please note while judging!!:</h1> Many of the conventional "best practices" associated with react and other libraries (such as not importing too many libraries, not using inline functions, etc.) may not apply to svelte as it is a compiler, not a framework. It intelligently compiles the svelte code into js, html, and css, applies treeshaking to libraries (only using the parts required), and optimizes the code for best performance and smallest bundle.js sizes possible. That also means that conventional known "bad practices" may not apply to svelte as it can compile the code and not face performance losses (for certain practices) where other non-compiled traditional frontend frameworks would.**

Most of the bundle.js size for this project comes from the code/libraries for the firebase API.
